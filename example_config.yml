## Set the channels key below to refer to set up channel references for your server
# channels:
##  Use the format 'reference_name:channel_name_or_id'
## The below example will set references in the code to 'dev' or 'bugs' channels to your server's general channel
#   dev: general
#   bugs: general

## Set the primary_guild if you want to make role permissions available via PM
## This will also prevent your instance from joining other servers
# primary_guild: your_server_id

## Set ignore_role to the name or id of a role if you want that role to be applied when you !ignore someone
# ignore_role: name_or_id_of_role

## Set bug_role to the name or id of a role you want mentioned whenever a user submits a !bug report
# bug_role: name_or_id_of_role

## Set party_category to the name or id of a channel category in your server where you want parties to be created
# party_category: name_or_id_of_category

## Set use_shlex to true if you want to split command arguments using quotes.
## If a command uses a specific delimiter, that delimiter will be used instead and quotes will not be respected
# use_shlex: true

## Set disable_delimiters to true if you want to override command delimiters when use_shlex is true
## If a command uses a specific delimiter, ignore it, and use arguments as split by shlex
# disable_delimiters: true

## Set prefix to be the prefix recognized by Beymax for commands
## Any messages starting with this string will be checked against the command list
# prefix: "!"

## Set name to be the username you wish to use for Beymax
## Beymax will change its username if this value has changed since the last startup
# name: Beymax

## Set send_traces to True if you want Beymax to send stack traces to the bugs channel
## Anytime Beymax encounters an exception it will be posted to the bugs channel instead of just printed to Beymax's console
# send_traces: True

## Permission safety options:
## Sets behavior for when users or roles change names so that a user/role name in
## the permissions file matches a different discord entity than previously (or no longer match an entity)
## "strict": Display a list of all mismatched/unmatched entities and quit.
##           Administrator must manually update permissions file. Safest option
## "previous": (Default) Ignore new entities. Permissions will apply to the same
##             entities referenced in the permissions fingerprint taken from the
##             last startup. This ensures consistency
## "update": As long as all names match AN entity, automatically update the fingerprint.
##           If any names are unmatched, fail. This is the least safe option, but
##           matches previous beymax behavior
# permissions_matching: previous
